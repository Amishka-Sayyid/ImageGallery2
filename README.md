a repo to try doing the week2-assignment of image gallery in a diffrent way but having the same concept. this time trying to show the large container inside the thumbnail container so that when image is clicked the images shows over the other images.

**User Stories**

🐿️ As a user, I want the website design to adjust using media queries so that it works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens.

🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I expect accessible considerations like alternative text for images so my screen reader can interpret and convey the content to me effectively.

🐿️ As a user, I want to easily switch between images in the gallery using buttons so that my experience is smooth and intuitive.

**Stretch Goals**

_Stretch User Stories_

🐿️ As a user, I want the website to use ‘srcset’ to display appropriately sized images for my device, so that images load quickly and look sharp on any screen.

🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I want ARIA elements, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes, to improve my interaction with the website.

🐿️ As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts, like arrow keys, to switch between images easily.

🐿️ As a user on various devices, I want the website to adapt to different screen sizes through the use of media queries for an optimal viewing experience.
